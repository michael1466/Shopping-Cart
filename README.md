# Shopping-Cart
Project for MGCR 233 data programming class, my group was tasked with first creating the ItemToPurchase class in part 1.
In part 2 we extended this by creating the ShoppingCart class which includes features such as add to cart, remove from cart, view items in cart, and view item decscriptions.
